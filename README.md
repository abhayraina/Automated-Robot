# Automated-Robot
This was a project created at DEEP Summer Academy, in which we were to design and build a robot which could locate itself within a given map, through 2D localization. 

The Robot then could navigate itself to a given position on the map.

All of this was achieved through probability which was calculated using the convolution technique.

# Instructions:
- Import the UltraSonic-Reader repo first, in the project folder
- Run the code in HistogramLocalization2D folder
